# toh2xml
The toh2xml.rb script tackles the following task:
Given a CSV file (e.g. toh-uri.csv) containing mappings from T≈çhoku number to the corresponding BUDA-BASE resource id (for Derge Kangyur only?)
Generating a xml file that represent the same mapping (see toh-uri.csv) 
The CSV file is a result from a SPARQL query and was provided by our partners at BDRC (no names/emails mentioned on purpose)
